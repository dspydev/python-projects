# Introduction

Make sure to state the purpose of the case study. This includes what the scenario is and an explanation on how it relates to a real-world obstacle. Feel free to note any assumptions or theories you might have depending on the information provided. 

# Problems

You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings.

# Solutions

Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution.

# Conclusion

End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this.

# Next steps

Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.
